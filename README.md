# [Try Again Lose Again] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Byte Bandits]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Noel Geevarghese Joseph] - [Albertian Institute of Science and Technology]
- Member 2: [Salvin Saju] - [Albertian Institute of Science and Technology]

### Project Description
[This project is an interactive "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game that uses hand gestures detected through a webcam. It employs OpenCV for video capture, MediaPipe for hand tracking, and Pygame for sound effects. Players compete against the computer, with the game tracking scores and providing visual feedback, including a loading animation and notifications for wins and losses. The interface features a background image, highlights for detected gestures, and prompts for starting and resetting the game.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[There is a delay of 5-10 secs to run the game initially] 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[It can be solved by reducing the resolution]
